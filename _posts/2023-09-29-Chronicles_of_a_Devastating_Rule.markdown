These tablets introduce us to Rosarion, a Pink Panther whose very existence has been wiped from history—until now. His rule was draconian. Not content with mere wealth or power, Rosarion was obsessed with the color pink to a perilous extent. Imagine a civilization where the failure to mine pink gems resulted in public floggings or even execution. Historical documents mention widespread famine, riots, and an economy in shambles, all while Rosarion hoarded pink treasures in his palace.

This was a regime that was not just oppressive but also terrifyingly capricious, driven by Rosarion's obsessive quest to surround himself with all things pink. Let's delve into what this meant for his subjects:

1. **The Pink Tax**: Every household was mandated to contribute a "Pink Tax," which was essentially handing over any pink-colored objects, under the penalty of imprisonment. Even children's toys were not exempt.
2. **Forced Labor**: Men and women were conscripted into forced labor camps, where they mined for pink gemstones. Conditions were brutal, and workers who failed to meet quotas were publicly flogged.
3. **Draconian Laws**: Rosarion enacted laws that required even food to be dyed pink. Failure to comply led to harsh punishments, including the confiscation of property.
4. **The Pink Guard**: Rosarion's personal militia, known for their pink armor, were a constant presence. They conducted random searches and seizures, spreading fear and distrust among the community.
5. **Economic Ruin**: With resources diverted to Rosarion's pink obsession, agriculture and trade suffered. Famine was rampant, and those caught hoarding food were executed.
6. **Spiritual Desecration**: Even religious institutions were not spared. Temples were required to display pink banners, and religious texts had to be rewritten to incorporate Rosarion’s doctrines.
7. **Intellectual Repression**: Scholars and artists who refused to focus their work on the glory of the color pink were exiled or worse. Libraries that didn't carry texts praising Rosarion's reign were burned to the ground.

The tablets tell us of a people living under constant fear and deprivation, their lives upended by the whims of a single, obsessed ruler. The societal structure was turned upside down, as Rosarion’s pink obsession bled into laws, economy, religion, and daily life.
